      <h2>Hey there, I'm Oriane Uwineza </h2>
      <p>
        I’m a creative technologist and purpose-driven innovator passionate about using design and code to solve meaningful problems.
        From setting up networks at IPRC Kigali to building beautiful web interfaces at ALU, my journey has been all about learning,
        leading, and leaving a mark. Whether I'm developing intuitive websites or guiding teenage mothers back to school with
        Brainstorm Brigade, I believe in using tech for good.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor's in Software Engineering at African Leadership University, where I co-lead group projects,
        mentor peers, and collaborate on impact-driven digital products. I thrive in spaces where empathy meets logic, where user
        experience matters just as much as clean code.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding, I enjoy journaling, mentoring, writing creative pieces, and accumulating digital experiences that tell stories.
        I dream of building a tech brand that combines beauty, purpose, and boldness empowering others, especially girls, across Africa.
